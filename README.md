# semtag-generator
A bash script to help generate git tags following semantic versioning

Generates, increments and pushes an annotated semantic version tag for current git repository.

## Usage:
  `sh tag-release [-b|--branch] [-d|--date] [-h|--help] [-m|--message] [-p|--previous] [-r|--remote] [-v|--version-type]`

## Options:
`-b,--branch <branch>`

Branch to generate release tag on.
     If ommited, defaults to '*main*'

`-d,--date <date>`

Date string to specify when release was created.

If ommited, defaults to *%Y%m%d* of current date.


`-h,--help`

Prints this help.

`-m,--message <message>`

Message to use to annotate release.

If ommited a list of non-merge commit messages will be compiled as release annotation.

If ommited and `-p <commit>` is given, will compile a list of non-merge commit messages between `<commit>` and HEAD.

If ommited and `-p` is not given, will compile a list of non-merge commit messages between last found release and HEAD.

`-p,--previous <commit>`

Previous commit to use to generate release notes.

If ommited, will attempt to get commit hash of last release tag.

`-r,--remote <remote>`

Name of remote to use for pushing.

If ommited, defaults to '*origin*'

`-v,--version-type [major|minor|patch]`
